Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me-  
 "We play from the time we wake till the day ends.  
 We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon."  
 I ask, "But how am I to get up to you ?"  
 They answer, "Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your  
hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds."  
 "My mother is waiting for me at home, "I say, "How can I leave  
her and come?"  
 Then they smile and float away.
